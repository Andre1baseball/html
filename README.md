=====================

Welcome to the Basic Markup assignment from WATS1010: Introduction to Web
Development.

In this assignment you will mark up a document based on the decision from
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren in the 1954 *Brown v. Board of Education*
case that made segregated schools illegal in the United States. This is a
landmark decision, and heartening to read, but we are not focusing so much on
the words as the structure.

The goal of this assignment is to practice marking up documents. You will be
expected to use a set of common tags:

* document tags (html, head, body, meta, link, script)
* headings (h1...h6)
* paragraphs (p)
* links (a)
* lists (ul, li)
* images (img)
* text formatting (b, i, sup, sub)

Refer to the resources listed within the course pages to get more information
about formatting HTML and using the tags listed above.

Requirements
------------

This assignment has several requirements. Complete this list of tasks in order
to complete the assignment:

1. Review the PDF in this repository (brown_v_board_of_education.pdf) to see
   the goal formatting for your final document. Your task is to match this
   formatting as closely as possible.
2. Open the ``index.html`` file and you will find that all of the text of the
   document is waiting for you there. You must add tags to create the structure
   of an HTML5 document (using a proper HTML5 doctype declaration) and to
   create the layout as seen in the PDF.
3. Be sure to keep an eye out for all the details in the document: Names of
   court cases are italicized. The asterisk on one line near the beginning
   should be a superscript. There are some links in the document, some bold
   text, and headings are used properly to create a document hierarchy. All of
   this should be evident in the PDF. (Pro Tip: Use the "find" feature in your
   PDF viewer to find the names of court cases by looking for "v.".)
4. Place both images as they show up in the PDF example.
5. Once you've completed the mark up work, create a new branch called
   ``gh-pages`` and push it up to Github. (Note the URL where this page shows
   up.)
